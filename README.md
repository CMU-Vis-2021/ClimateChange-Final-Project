## Breakdown of work
The breakdown of work was split fairly evenly. Since our team only has two members, the best way we could attack this project is by splitting up the work as best as possible. For example, Jonathan did the visualizations for energy production and fossil fuel emissions and the introduction of the observable notebook, the entire report, and half of the video. Helena did the visualizations for agricultural activity and deforestation and the conclusion of the observable notebook, the readme.md file, set up the GitHub items, and the other half of the video. Having only two members, it was a lot to juggle but we did the best that we could.

# Project process
The first step we took for this project was identifying the factors we wanted to include in our narrative and any other viewpoints of climate change. We originally had are energy production, agricultural activity, deforestation, industrial activity, Earth’s own feedback loop, and variations in the Sun’s intensity. We also had actions that various countries are taking in order to reduce the effects of global warming data points. We determined for the scope of this project we would reduce the number of factors to only energy production, agricultural activity, and deforestation and got rid of other countries' actions since we have a smaller team. After reducing our attributes, we then began creating visualizations for each of the factors. This took a significant amount of time since we kept running into errors in our code and having to format our datasets to function correctly. Once we finished our visualizations, we added commentary on each of the visualizations, an introduction and a conclusion, and then organized our notebook so that it was clean looking and professional. We finished our project by writing the report, creating the readme.md file, linking the GitHub pages, and filming our presentation video.
