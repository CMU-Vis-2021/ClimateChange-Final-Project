## Breakdown of work
The breakdown of work was split fairly evenly. Since our team only has two members, the best way we could attack this project is by splitting up the work as best as possible. For example, Jonathan did the visualizations for energy production and fossil fuel emissions and the conclusion of the observable notebook, the entire report, and half of the video. Helena did the visualizations for agricultural activity and deforestation and the introduction of the observable notebook, the read.me file, set up the GitHub items, and the other half of the video. Having only two members, it was a lot to juggle but we did the best that we could.
